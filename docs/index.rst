Welcome to HOME's documentation!
This documentation is still work in progress, but serves to easier navigate the 
HOME projects main code base - downloading orthophotos from norgeibilder.no, 
training a neural network to detect buildings, applying this model to predict 
building footprints on all orthophotos and finally analyzing the history of buildings.
