# install with "python3 -m pip install -e ."
# remember to do so within your environment....
# (also redo after changing anything outside the file you're running)
# also - you create "local_demolition_footprints.egg-info" the root of the project, 
# which you should then delete (it will reappear when you run the above command again)
